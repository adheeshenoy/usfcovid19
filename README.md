# University of South Florida Covid-19 Dashboard

## Summary
Unfortunately, due to changes made to the University of South Florida's Website, we are no longer able to gather data from the website. You can find a video of the website at [https://bit.ly/3mmEGDe] (here)

I partnered with a [student](https://github.com/Rafael1321/USF-COVID-19) to develop a dashboard to present COVID-19 cases on the University of South Florida (USF) campuses. The main reason for the website was to track the cases and find patterns in the data. It also served a purpose to practice using python3 and other tools. 

## Technologies Used
* Python3
* Dash
* Pandas (For data manipulation)
* BeautifulSoup4 (For web scraping the USF Coronavirus website)
* Plotly (For creating the interactive graphs)
* Heroku (For hosting the website)
* FBPropher
* PostgreSQL
* Google Analytics (For gathering website traffic data)

## Scripts used
We also modified these scripts to improve the user experience for the website

* [PleaseRotate.js](https://github.com/arscan/pleaserotate.js)
* [Range.py](https://github.com/danio/plotly_tools/blob/master/range.py)
