# University of South Florida Covid-19 Dashboard

## Summary
You can check out the website at [https://usfcovid19.herokuapp.com](https://usfcovid19.herokuapp.com)

I partnered with a [student](https://github.com/Rafael1321/USF-COVID-19) to develop a dashboard to present COVID-19 cases on the University of South Florida (USF) campuses. The main reason for the website was to track the cases and find patterns in the data. It also served a purpose to practice using python3 and other tools. 

## Technologies Used
* Python3
* Dash
* Pandas (For data manipulation)
* BeautifulSoup4 (For web scraping the USF Coronavirus website)
* Plotly (For creating the interactive graphs)
* Heroku (For hosting the website)
* Google Analytics (For gathering website traffic data)
